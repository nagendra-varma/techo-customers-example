Title : Enterprise App

Domain: Information Technology, Android applications.

Problem Statement: An Android application which configures an Android phone enables the Enterprise mode of access to phone.

Description:
Many enterprises wants a customized Android phone to give to user with limited access to the features. Like in Banking domain enterprises
restrict access to camera, file upload / download access etc. But it becomes very expensive to implement all these kind of features
in Android OS. So many of the enterprises uses legacy Blackberry or other kind of phones who provided the enterprise mode but
they are also very expensive to buy or maintain. I'm writing an Android app which does all of the above without any Android OS 
customizations which is less expensive and works with any Android phone. So an Organization can choose the Android phone with in
their budget and install this application to enable Enterprise mode and everything else is taken care.
